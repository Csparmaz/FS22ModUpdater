# FS22ModUpdater. //RECOMMENDED TO NOT USE!!!!
extremely insecure and janky. it includes your ftp link WITH password, it downloads files to your active modfolders (as if fs mods dont have enough viruses) and its just bad in general. not recommended but it works ig

A bad batch script that updates and installs mods from a farming simulator 22 FTP server. Works on all Windows machines.

TO USE:
Insert your FTP Url in the parts where it says so.


::::IMPORTANT:::

You HAVE to make a file called 1.txt in your servers mod folder which includes all modnames and extensions like this:

UniversalAutoload.zip

AutoDrive.zip

This will NOT work without this, im trying to fix this so that its completely independent from the server. Curl sucks.

---------------
Thats it. now send it to your friends or something for them to automatically use it.

Going to try to update it so it doesnt even need to use Curl.
